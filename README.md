# Blockchain
This is about how to create a blockchain in python

Required things:
1. Compiler (Vs code or Pycharm)
2. Install the hashlib in your device ("pip install hashlib")

Copy and paste the code in your compiler and save it with the extension .py . Click compile and run you will get the output . You can modify the above code and use it in your project.

The output which consist of hash of the block , hash of the previous block and data.

I created two class here, one is for Block and another one is for Blockchain.
